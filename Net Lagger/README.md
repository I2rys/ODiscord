## How does ODiscord Net Lagger works
Once the file is runned, the file will check if Discord folder exist on AppData  to see If Discord is installed and once the directory exist it will go to a Discord module called Discord Voice, then inject a malicious code to It's index.js. But It will only work If the user has NPM installed on their computer.
